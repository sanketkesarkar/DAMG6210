## Sample DDL Statements

Create a car by inserting into `CarProduction` - it will automatically deduct the stock of the required parts from the `Stock` table, based on `CarBlueprint`

```sql
CREATE or ALTER TRIGGER CarProduction_Stock_Consume
ON CarProduction
AFTER INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    -- trigger for consuming parts (quantity) from stock when a car is produced

    WITH RankedRows AS ( -- select all candidate batches and rank them based on quantity
    select B.part_id, S.batch_id, S.location_id, S.quantity, CB.part_count, CB.car_id
    , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY B.part_id ORDER BY quantity DESC) AS RowNumber
    from inserted I
    inner join AssemblyUnit A on A.AssemblyUnitID = I.manufactured_at_id
    inner join [Location] L on L.LocationID = A.location_id
    inner join CarBlueprint CB on CB.car_id = I.car_id
    inner join Batch B on B.part_id = CB.part_id
    inner join Stock S on S.batch_id = B.BatchID and S.location_id = L.LocationID
    )
    update RankedRows
    set quantity = quantity - (part_count * (select count(1) from inserted II where II.car_id = RankedRows.car_id)) -- in case multiple production of the same car is inserted
    where RowNumber = 1

END
```

When inserting a row `TransactionRow`, the stock is automatically transferred from one location from the other in the `Stock` table

```sql
CREATE or ALTER TRIGGER StockUpdate
ON TransactionRow
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    -- handle updated rows
    update sf
    set sf.quantity = sf.quantity - (d.quantity - i.quantity)
    from inserted i inner join deleted d on i.TransactionRowID = d.TransactionRowID and i.quantity <> d.quantity
        inner join [Transaction] t on i.transaction_id = t.TransactionID
        inner join Stock sf on sf.location_id = t.from_location_id and i.part_batch_id = sf.batch_id

    update st
    set st.quantity = st.quantity + (d.quantity - i.quantity)
    from inserted i inner join deleted d on i.TransactionRowID = d.TransactionRowID and i.quantity <> d.quantity
        inner join [Transaction] t on i.transaction_id = t.TransactionID
        inner join Stock st on st.location_id = t.to_location_id and i.part_batch_id = st.batch_id


    -- handle deleted row
    update sf
        set sf.quantity = sf.quantity + d.quantity
         from deleted d inner join [transaction] t on d.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from inserted) and t.TransactionID = d.transaction_id
        inner join stock sf on sf.location_id = t.from_location_id

    update st
        set st.quantity = st.quantity - d.quantity
         from deleted d inner join [transaction] t on d.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from inserted) and t.TransactionID = d.transaction_id
        inner join stock st on st.location_id = t.to_location_id

    -- handle inserted row
    update sf
        set sf.quantity = sf.quantity - i.quantity
         from inserted i inner join [transaction] t on i.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from deleted) and t.TransactionID = i.transaction_id
        inner join stock sf on sf.location_id = t.from_location_id

    update st
        set st.quantity = st.quantity + i.quantity
         from inserted i inner join [transaction] t on i.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from deleted) and t.TransactionID = i.transaction_id
        inner join stock st on st.location_id = t.to_location_id

END
```

View for checking the total sales of all parts in the database

```sql
create or alter view sales_by_parts
as
    select part_id, p.PartName, p.[description], sum(total_price) [Total_Sales]
    from [Transaction] t inner join TransactionRow r on t.TransactionID = r.transaction_id and transaction_type = 'S'
        inner join Batch b on r.part_batch_id = b.BatchID
        inner join Part p on p.PartID = b.BatchID
    group by part_id, p
.PartName, p.[description]
GO
create or alter view transaction_logistics
as
    select dbo.calc_distance(f.latitude, f.longitude, t.latitude, t.longitude) [TransportationDistance],
        dbo.calc_distance(f.latitude, f.longitude, t.latitude, t.longitude) * tr.[cost_per_km] [TransportCost], [transaction].*
    from [Transaction] inner join [Location] [f] on [Transaction].from_location_id = f.LocationID
        inner join [Location] [t] on [Transaction].to_location_id = t.LocationID
        inner join [Transport] tr on tr.TransportID = [Transaction].transported_by_id
go
create or alter view sales_by_date
as
    select convert(DATE,created_date) TDATE, sum(total_amount) SalesForTheDay
    from [Transaction]
    group by convert(DATE,created_date)
go
create or alter view sales_by_month
as
    select MONTH(created_date) TDATE, sum(total_amount) SalesForTheMonth
    from [Transaction]
    group by MONTH(created_date)
```

Procedure for getting all the cars that are in production

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE GetCarsInProduction
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT
        [CarID],
        [CarName],
        [production_year_start],
        [production_year_end],
        [brand_id],
        [type_id]
    FROM
        [dbo].[Car]
    WHERE
        GETDATE() BETWEEN [production_year_start] AND [production_year_end]
```

Triggers & Checks to ensure valid data

```sql
-- Prevents Updates or Deletes on the CarProduction Table
CREATE OR ALTER TRIGGER Prevent_CarProduction_Update_Delete ON CarProduction
INSTEAD OF DELETE, UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    RAISERROR('Updates and deletes are not allowed on this table.', 16, 1);
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
END
GO
-- Ensure non-negative values
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[CarBlueprint] ADD CONSTRAINT [Blueprint_Count_Positive] CHECK (part_count >= 0);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Stock] ADD CONSTRAINT [Stock_Quantity_Positive] CHECK (quantity >= 0);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[TransactionRow] ADD CONSTRAINT [TransactionRow_Quantity_Positive] CHECK (quantity >= 0);
```

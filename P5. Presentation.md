## Sample DDL Statements

Create a car by inserting into `CarProduction` - it will automatically deduct the stock of the required parts from the `Stock` table, based on `CarBlueprint`

```sql
CREATE or ALTER TRIGGER CarProduction_Stock_Consume
ON CarProduction
AFTER INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    -- trigger for consuming parts (quantity) from stock when a car is produced

    WITH RankedRows AS ( -- select all candidate batches and rank them based on quantity
    select B.part_id, S.batch_id, S.location_id, S.quantity, CB.part_count, CB.car_id
    , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY B.part_id ORDER BY quantity DESC) AS RowNumber
    from inserted I
    inner join AssemblyUnit A on A.AssemblyUnitID = I.manufactured_at_id
    inner join [Location] L on L.LocationID = A.location_id
    inner join CarBlueprint CB on CB.car_id = I.car_id
    inner join Batch B on B.part_id = CB.part_id
    inner join Stock S on S.batch_id = B.BatchID and S.location_id = L.LocationID
    )
    update RankedRows
    set quantity = quantity - (part_count * (select count(1) from inserted II where II.car_id = RankedRows.car_id)) -- in case multiple production of the same car is inserted
    where RowNumber = 1

END
```

When inserting a row `TransactionRow`, the stock is automatically transferred from one location from the other in the `Stock` table

```sql
CREATE or ALTER TRIGGER StockUpdate
ON TransactionRow
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    -- handle updated rows
    update sf
    set sf.quantity = sf.quantity - (d.quantity - i.quantity)
    from inserted i inner join deleted d on i.TransactionRowID = d.TransactionRowID and i.quantity <> d.quantity
        inner join [Transaction] t on i.transaction_id = t.TransactionID
        inner join Stock sf on sf.location_id = t.from_location_id and i.part_batch_id = sf.batch_id

    update st
    set st.quantity = st.quantity + (d.quantity - i.quantity)
    from inserted i inner join deleted d on i.TransactionRowID = d.TransactionRowID and i.quantity <> d.quantity
        inner join [Transaction] t on i.transaction_id = t.TransactionID
        inner join Stock st on st.location_id = t.to_location_id and i.part_batch_id = st.batch_id


    -- handle deleted row
    update sf
        set sf.quantity = sf.quantity + d.quantity
         from deleted d inner join [transaction] t on d.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from inserted) and t.TransactionID = d.transaction_id
        inner join stock sf on sf.location_id = t.from_location_id

    update st
        set st.quantity = st.quantity - d.quantity
         from deleted d inner join [transaction] t on d.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from inserted) and t.TransactionID = d.transaction_id
        inner join stock st on st.location_id = t.to_location_id

    -- handle inserted row
    update sf
        set sf.quantity = sf.quantity - i.quantity
         from inserted i inner join [transaction] t on i.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from deleted) and t.TransactionID = i.transaction_id
        inner join stock sf on sf.location_id = t.from_location_id

    update st
        set st.quantity = st.quantity + i.quantity
         from inserted i inner join [transaction] t on i.TransactionRowID not in (select TransactionRowID
            from deleted) and t.TransactionID = i.transaction_id
        inner join stock st on st.location_id = t.to_location_id

END
